The impact of flooding which is quite extensive on the community makes flooding becomes one of the most detrimental disasters in Indonesia. It cannot be denied that flooding has become a government concern in the last decade. There are a number of factors that can influence the occurrence of flooding such as temperature and precipitation levels. However, not many studies have discussed the effect of average temperature and precipitation on flooding. For this reason, this study was conducted to find out the effect of average temperature and precipitation on flooding in Indonesia. In this study, flood data, climate data, and geospatial datasets were used. These data will be visualized by using Tableau workbooks. Data visualization is done by combining the data with the left join technique. After that, data will be visualized by using the concept of level of detail, mapping, clustering, trend analysis, and forecasting as well as a number of charts such as line charts, bar charts, pareto charts, control diagrams, and others. With this research, it is hoped that it can add insight and knowledge to readers regarding the effect of average temperature and rainfall levels on floods in Indonesia.
